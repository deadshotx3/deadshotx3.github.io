Choosing your first camera can be overwhelming. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you make the right decision.

## Understanding Camera Types

### DSLR vs Mirrorless
Both have their advantages:
- DSLRs offer better battery life and a traditional viewfinder
- Mirrorless cameras are more compact and often better for video

### Key Features to Consider

1. **Sensor Size**
   - Full-frame for professional quality
   - APS-C for a good balance of quality and price
   - Micro 4/3 for portability

2. **Megapixels**
   - 20-24MP is plenty for most users
   - Higher isn't always better

3. **Autofocus System**
   - More focus points generally mean better autofocus
   - Eye/Face detection is valuable for portraits

## Budget Considerations

Remember to factor in:
- Extra lenses
- Memory cards
- Spare batteries
- Camera bag

## Recommended Starter Cameras

- Canon EOS Rebel series
- Nikon D3500
- Sony A6000 series
- Fujifilm X-T200

Choose based on your specific needs and budget, not just brand names.
